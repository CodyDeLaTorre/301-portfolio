I spent five years in the Army working as an all-source intelligence analyst and personnel security manager. I led junior soldiers, managed over 500 cleared personnel files while keeping them up to date on security training, and gave enemy update briefs to commanders. I made a career change to Software Developement because I love to solve complex problems and build beautiful applications",

      "description": "ðŸ‘‹  My name is Code De La Torre, and I am a Software Developer with a military background. I spent five years in the Army working as an all-source intelligence analyst and personnel security manager. I led junior soldiers, managed over 500 cleared personnel files while keeping them up to date on security training, and gave enemy update briefs to commanders. I made a career change in September of 2022 to become a Software Developer because I found a passion for coding when I took a python class at Arizona State University.",
